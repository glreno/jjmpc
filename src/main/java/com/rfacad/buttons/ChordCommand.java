/**
* Combine two (or more) button presses so that both buttons must
* be pressed for a command to occur.
* This works as a factory. A single ChordCommand wraps a goal command list.
* But what you give to the ButtonMapper is ChordCommand.mkSet() and
* ChordCommand.mkCheck() -- those two factory methods return ButtonCommands
* that set, check, and clear state in this object. If both mkSet() have been
* called, mkCheck() will pass and run the commands. Otherwise, mkCheck()
* clears the state for its button.
